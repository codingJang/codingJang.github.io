I'm Yejun Jang, an AI researcher and undergraduate student at Seoul National University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research interests lie at the intersection of **deep learning** and **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, with a focus on developing intelligent systems that can learn, cooperate, and make strategic decisions.

Currently, I'm working on exciting projects in reinforcement learning, including simulating currency wars using multi-agent RL and developing flow-based Q-learning algorithms. My work has been recognized at international venues including CoRL 2025 Workshop RemembeRL and various Korean conferences.

**Research Interests:**
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Deep Q-Learning and flow-based methods
- Generative AI (VAE, GAN)
- AI security and robustness

I'm passionate about making complex AI concepts accessible and have experience communicating technical ideas to diverse audiences. I've also been recognized as a 2020 Regeneron ISEF finalist for my work on computer vision-based posture correction systems.

When I'm not researching, I enjoy working on creative projects that blend AI with practical applications, from VR quantum computing education to automated penetration testing systems.
