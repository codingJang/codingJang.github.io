I'm still grappling with it, it's a challenging book to read. In summary, Roger Penrose says "no" to the question "can machines truly think and act like humans do?" and uses GÃ¶del's Incompleteness theorem, Lambda calculus and his work on quantum gravity etc. as supporting evidence. 

I was recommended this book by my physics prof. Namkyoo Park ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_U_wKPcAAAAJ&hl=en)) and his open argument (left to the class to verify) was that the current AI systems would not be able to "discover" quantum mechanical laws by itself, if it were only given the experimental data and not the textbook. 

Although three years have passed since then, I still want to find the answer to this question - I wonder whether letting AI systems use quantum computers as their playground would facilitate novel discoveries that humans alone could not have discovered (or, whether generalizing from small amounts of experiment data is something only humans are capable of).
