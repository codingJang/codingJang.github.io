We then know the performance of the policy $\pi$. Since this is a q-value function, we can also use it to greedify our policy $\pi$ by $\pi \leftarrow \argmax_{a\in A} q^\pi(s, a)$.</p> <h2 id="properties-of-the-bellman-operators">Properties of the Bellman Operators</h2> <h3 id="properties-bellman-optimality-operator-t_v--t">Properties: Bellman Optimality Operator $T_V^* \;(= T^*)$</h3> <ol> <li>$T^<em>$ has a unique fixed point $v^</em>$.</li> <li> <p>$T^*$ is a $\gamma$-contraction with respect to $|\cdot|_\infty$:</p> \[\|T^*v-T^*u\|_\infty \le \gamma \|v-u\|_\infty, \forall u,v \in V\] </li> <li>$T^*$ is monotonic:</li> </ol> \[\forall u,v \in V \text{ s.t. } u \le v \text{ component-wise, then } T^*u \le T^*v\] <p><strong>The properties are similar for all other operators.</strong></p> <h2 id="approximate-dp">Approximate DP</h2> <p>So far, we have assumed perfect knowledge of the MDP &amp; perfect/exact representation of the value functions. However, we often encounter situations where we don’t know the underlying MDP or cannot represent the value function exactly after each update.</p> <p>Therefore, we will have to use approximate versions of the value functions / Bellman Operators. However, when the approximation is really bad, iteratively applying the approximated Bellman Operator to an initial function may not guarantee convergence.</p> <p>An example of divergence induced by some approximation is explored in the lecture. However, in most cases, divergence is not an issue. In the lecture, it is mentioned that “sample versions of these algorithms converge under mild conditions, and even for the function approximation case, the theoretical danger of divergence is rarely materialised in practice.”</p> <h2 id="theorem-value-of-a-greedy-policy">Theorem (Value of a greedy Policy)</h2> <p>Consider an MDP.

(Why?)</li> <li>If $\gamma=0$, then $q^*=q^\pi$. Therefore, the greedy policy associated with any $q$ yields the optimal value function.</li> <li>If $q=q^<em>$, it means that the value function, from which you are about to make the greedy policy out of, is the optimal value function. The greedy policy is the optimal policy, hence $q^</em>=q^\pi$ in this case.</li> </ol> </body></html>
