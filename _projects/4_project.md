## Project Overview

Car-The-Garden is a robotics project that implements autonomous navigation for a miniature vehicle to complete a scaled-down version of the standard Korean driving test course. The project demonstrates practical applications of classic search algorithms in real-world navigation scenarios.

### The Challenge

The Korean driving test includes various challenging maneuvers:
- Parallel parking
- T-junction navigation
- Narrow path following
- Obstacle avoidance
- Precise turning and positioning

Implementing these in an autonomous system requires:
- Accurate path planning
- Real-time decision making
- Sensor integration
- Motor control precision

### Technical Approach

**Search Algorithms**
- **Left-First Search**: Prioritizes left-side paths for certain scenarios
- **Right-First Search**: Prioritizes right-side paths for alternative navigation
- Adaptive algorithm selection based on course requirements

**Navigation System**
- Sensor data processing for environment awareness
- Real-time path planning and execution
- Motor control for precise movements
- Course completion optimization

### Implementation Details

The system combines:
- **Sensing**: Environmental detection (likely using ultrasonic/infrared sensors)
- **Planning**: Search algorithm-based path finding
- **Control**: Motor actuation for steering and speed
- **Execution**: Real-time navigation through the course

### Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience with:
- Robotics hardware integration
- Classical AI search algorithms
- Real-time system constraints
- Sensor-motor coordination
- Practical problem-solving in robotics

### Technical Stack

- **Hardware**: Miniature vehicle platform, sensors, motors
- **Software**: Python or C for control logic
- **Algorithms**: Search algorithms (BFS/DFS variants)
- **Skills**: Embedded systems, robotics, algorithm implementation

### Significance

Car-The-Garden demonstrates:
- Practical application of theoretical algorithms
- Integration of software and hardware systems
- Problem decomposition in complex tasks
- Real-world constraint handling
