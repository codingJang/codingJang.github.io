## Project Overview

FHP-RTFS (Forward Head Posture - Real-Time Feedback System) is a computer vision-based solution for detecting and correcting poor posture when using digital devices. This project became a 2020 Regeneron ISEF finalist.

### The Problem

Forward Head Posture (FHP) is a growing health concern in the digital age, where prolonged use of computers and mobile devices leads to:
- Neck and shoulder pain
- Reduced lung capacity
- Headaches and fatigue
- Long-term spinal issues

Traditional measurement methods require physical medical devices and cannot provide real-time feedback during device usage.

### Our Solution

We developed a contactless feedback system that:
1. Uses 3D webcam data for markerless skeletal tracking
2. Measures FHP angle in real-time without any physical attachments
3. Provides audio feedback when posture deteriorates
4. Tracks improvement over time

### Technical Implementation

**Computer Vision Pipeline**
- Implemented markerless skeletal tracking using depth cameras
- Developed novel measurement criterion for FHP angle
- Real-time processing of 3D point cloud data
- Audio feedback system for immediate user notification

**Key Technologies**
- 3D depth sensing cameras
- Computer vision algorithms for pose estimation
- Real-time data processing
- Audio feedback generation

### Results

Our system demonstrated remarkable effectiveness:
- **81% improvement** in participants' Forward Head Posture
- Non-invasive measurement without medical equipment
- Real-time feedback enables immediate behavior correction
- Scalable solution applicable to various environments

### Recognition

- **2020 Regeneron ISEF Finalist** - One of the world's largest international pre-college science competitions
- **2019 Korea Science and Engineering Fair (KSEF) Gold Award** - First place, leading to ISEF qualification
- **2020 SASA Campus Awards (Research)** - Recognized for outstanding research contribution

### Impact

This project demonstrates how accessible technology can address real health concerns:
- Makes posture correction technology available without expensive medical equipment
- Provides immediate feedback rather than periodic check-ups
- Scalable to home, office, and educational environments
- Proved the effectiveness of preventive health technology
