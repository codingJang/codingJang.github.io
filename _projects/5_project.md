## Project Overview

Rev-Missiles! is a reverse engineering project where I decompiled, analyzed, and modified the mobile game "MISSILES!" to add custom features and additional missiles. This project showcases software analysis, modification techniques, and creative problem-solving.

### The Challenge

Reverse engineering a compiled mobile game requires:
- **Decompilation**: Converting compiled code back to readable format
- **Code Analysis**: Understanding the game's architecture and logic
- **Modification**: Adding new features without breaking existing functionality
- **Recompilation**: Building the modified version successfully

### Technical Process

**Analysis Phase**
1. Decompiled the mobile application
2. Analyzed game structure and code organization
3. Identified key systems (missile mechanics, physics, rendering)
4. Located modification points for adding features

**Modification Phase**
1. Designed new missile types with unique behaviors
2. Implemented custom missile logic
3. Integrated new assets and mechanics
4. Tested for stability and gameplay balance

**Integration Phase**
1. Ensured compatibility with existing game systems
2. Debugged issues introduced by modifications
3. Recompiled and deployed modified version

### Learning Outcomes

This project provided valuable experience in:
- **Reverse Engineering**: Understanding compiled software structure
- **Code Analysis**: Reading and comprehending unfamiliar codebases
- **Software Modification**: Changing existing systems safely
- **Game Development**: Understanding game mechanics and physics
- **Problem Solving**: Debugging complex integration issues
