## Project Overview

SOUL is an ambitious research project funded by the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) that uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to simulate currency wars and derive novel economical and political strategies.

### Goal

The primary objective is to simulate complex economic scenarios involving currency competition between multiple agents, allowing us to:
- Understand emergent behaviors in currency markets
- Derive new strategic insights for economic policy
- Demonstrate the power of cooperative AI through communication

### Technical Approach

**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
- Implemented game-playing AI agents using Deep Q-Learning
- Agents learn to cooperate and compete through communication channels
- Utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential decision-making

**Infrastructure**
- Deployed on Google Cloud Platform for scalable training
- Managed distributed training across multiple compute instances
- Optimized for large-scale simulations with thousands of interactions

### Key Achievements

- **Funding**: Secured 10 million KRW (~$10,000 CAD) in project funding
- **Resource Management**: Successfully allocated resources for computing infrastructure, expert mentoring, accommodation, and educational materials
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Communicated complex AI concepts including LSTM to team members with non-technical backgrounds
- **Ongoing Research**: Project continues to evolve with new findings since February 2022

### Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, PettingZoo (for multi-agent environments)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform

### Team & Role

As Project Head, I:
- Lead the technical architecture and implementation
- Manage team coordination and resource allocation
- Communicate with stakeholders and mentor team members
- Drive research direction and publication efforts
